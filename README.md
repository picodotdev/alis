Arch Linux Install Script (or alis, also known as _the Arch Linux executable installation guide and wiki_) installs unattended, automated and customized Arch Linux system.

It is a simple bash script based in many Arch Linux Wiki pages that fully automates the installation of a Arch Linux system after booting from the original Arch Linux installation media. It contains the same commands that you would type and execute one by one interactively to complete the installation. The only user intervention needed is to edit a configuration file to choose the installation options and preferences from partitioning, to encryption, bootloader, file system, language and keyboard mapping, desktop environment, kernels, packages to install and graphic drivers. This automation makes the installation easy and fast, fast as less than 4 minutes.

If some time later after an system update for any reason the system does not boot correctly a recovery script is also provided to enter in a recovery mode that allows to downgrade packages or execute any other commands to restore the system. Also a log of the installation can be taken with <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a>.

**Warning! This script can delete all partitions of the persistent storage. It is recommended to test it first in a virtual machine like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.**

Currently these scripts are for me but maybe they are useful for you too.

Follow the [Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) of doing things and learn what this script does. This will allow you to know what is happening.

Please, don't ask for support for this script in Arch Linux forums, first read the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) and the [General Recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations), later compare those commands with the commands of this script.

For new features, improvements and bugs fill an issue in GitHub or make a pull request. You can test it in a virtual machine (strongly recommended) like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) before run it in real hardware. If you test it in real hardware please send me an email to pico.dev@gmail.com with the machine description and tell me if something goes wrong or all works fine. [Pull request](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis/pulls) and [new feature request](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis/issues) are welcome!

**Arch Linux Install Script (alis) is based on Arch Linux but is NOT approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its related projects.**

## System installation

Download and boot from the latest <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">original Arch Linux installation media</a>. After boot use the following commands to start the installation.

Follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux">Arch Way</a> of doing things and learn what this script does. This will allow you to know what is happening.

Internet connection is required, with wireless WIFI connection see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wireless_network_configuration#Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">Wireless_network_configuration</a> to bring up WIFI connection before start the installation.

Minimum usage

```
#                         # Start the system with latest Arch Linux installation media
# loadkeys [keymap]       # Load keyboard keymap, eg. loadkeys es, loadkeys us, loadkeys de
# curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/picodotdev/alis/master/download.sh | bash     # Download alis scripts
# vim alis.conf           # Edit configuration and change variables values with your preferences (system configuration)
# ./alis.sh               # Start installation
```

Advanced usage

```
#                         # Start the system with latest Arch Linux installation media
# loadkeys [keymap]       # Load keyboard keymap, eg. loadkeys es, loadkeys us, loadkeys de
# iwctl --passphrase "[WIFI_KEY]" station [WIFI_INTERFACE] connect "[WIFI_ESSID]"          # (Optional) Connect to WIFI network. _ip link show_ to know WIFI_INTERFACE.
# curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/picodotdev/alis/master/download.sh | bash     # Download alis scripts
# # curl -sL https://git.io/JeaH6 | bash                                                   # Alternative download URL with URL shortener

# vim alis.conf           # Edit configuration and change variables values with your preferences (system configuration)
# vim alis-packages.conf  # (Optional) Edit configuration and change variables values with your preferences (packages to install)
#                         # (The preferred way to install packages is after system installation, see Packages installation)
# ./alis.sh               # Start installation
# ./alis-reboot.sh        # (Optional) Reboot the system, only necessary when REBOOT="false"
```

## Packages installation

After the base Arch Linux system is installed, alis can install packages with pacman, Flatpak, SDKMAN and from AUR.

```
#                                  # After system installation start a user session

## How you can help

* Test in VirtualBox and create an issue if something does not work, attach the main parts of the used configuration file and the error message
* Create issues with new features
* Send pull requests
* Share it in social networks, forums, create a blog post or video about it
* Send me an email, I like to read that the script is being used and is useful :). Which are your computer specs, which is your alis configuration, if is your personal or working computer, if all worked fine or some suggestion to improve the script

## Alternatives

There are other quite good similar projects that can be used as alternative to install a vanilla Arch Linux without any additions.

* [Arch Installer](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall) (included in the installation media)
* [archfi](https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi/)
* [Archlinux Ultimate Installer (aui)](https://github.com/helmuthdu/aui) (only accepts patches)

Also, if you prefer to install an Arch Linux using a guided graphical installer you can choose an [Arch based distribution](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions#Active). 

* [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/)
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
* [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
* [Archlabs](https://archlabslinux.com/)
* [RebornOS](https://rebornos.org/)
* [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org/)

Also and recomended for new Arch Linux new comers follow the Arch Way of doing things is a good way to use and learn about Arch. There are many guides out here, the official Arch Linux installation guide the first one. These are other good ones that explains step by step from instalation media creation to first boot and programs installation, all the necessary to start.

* [The Arch Linux Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-arch-linux/)

## Test in VirtualBox with Packer

VirtualBox and [Packer](https://packer.io/) are required.

* Firmware: efi, bios
* File system: ext4, btrfs, f2fs, xfs
* Partition: luks, lvm
* Bootloader: grub, refind, systemd
* Desktop environment: gnome, kde, xfce, ...

```

$ ./alis-packer.sh -c alis-packer-efi-ext4-luks-lvm-grub.sh
$ ./alis-packer.sh -c alis-packer-efi-btrfs-luks-lvm-systemd.sh
$ ./alis-packer.sh -c alis-packer-efi-f2fs-luks-lvm-systemd.sh
