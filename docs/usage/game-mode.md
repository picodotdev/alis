# Game mode

You can toggle a game mode to increase the performance in gaming situations from the sidebar app or with a key binding:

| Keybind | Action |
|--------|--------|
| <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> | Disable Hyprland animations and window blur |

With the same key binding you can bring back the effects.

If you want to enable the game mode permanently, you can activate the related variations in the ML4W Settings app:

Open the Appearance tab. Change the variations to:

- Decoration Variations: gamemode.conf
- Window Variations: gamemode.conf
- Animation Variations: disabled.conf
