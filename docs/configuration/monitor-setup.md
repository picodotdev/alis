You can also create your own variation as described [here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/wiki/Configuration-Variations).

<!-- maybe update this wiki link in the future -->

## Use nwg-displays

The ML4W Dotfiles are supporting the application [nwg-displays](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-displays) to configure your display settings.

Install nwg-displays on Arch Linux with

::: code-group

```sh [<i class="devicon-archlinux-plain"></i> Arch]
sudo pacman -S nwg-displays
```

```sh [<i class="devicon-fedora-plain"></i> Fedora]
sudo dnf install python-build python-installer python-wheel python-setuptools
git clone https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-displays ~/nwg-displays
cd ~/nwg-displays && chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
:::

Open the app and apply your desired monitor settings.
