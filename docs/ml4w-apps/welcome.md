You can also start the Welcome App from the terminal with 

```sh
ml4w
```
The welcome screen includes the most important keybindings to open a terminal or a browser.

You can start the ML4W Welcome App from the Sidebar by clicking on the `L` icon on the right side in waybar, using the rofi application launcher or by typing `ml4w` in your terminal (if you're using the `.bashrc` from the dotfiles).

You can find the sourcecode in [ML4W Welcome App repository](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles-welcome)
