The hyprpaper engine uses a template stored in `dotfiles/.settings/hyprpaper.tpl`. You can add additional configurations there. The `WALLPAPER` placeholder will be replaced with the current wallpaper.

You can add you own effects in the folder `/dotfiles/hypr/effects/wallpaper`

You can execute multiple `magick` commands. `$wallpaper` is the selected wallpaper, $used_wallpaper the executed wallpaper.

```sh
magick $wallpaper -negate $used_wallpaper
magick $used_wallpaper -brightness-contrast -20% $used_wallpaper
```

## Wallpaper Cache

Generated versions of a wallpaper will be cached in the folder `~/.config/ml4w/cache/wallpaper-generated`
This will speed up the switch between wallpapers if cached files exist. 

You can disable the cache in the ML4W Settings App.

You can clear the cache in the ML4W Settings App or with 

```sh
~/.config/hypr/scripts/wallpaper-cache.sh
```

You can regenerate the version of the current wallpaper by switching of the cache in the settings app and select the same wallpaper again.
