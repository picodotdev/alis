## Waybar Themes

The ML4W Dotfiles include a selection of themes for the status bar waybar. You can also add your own themes by using the waybar starter theme.

## Using the custom.conf

If you want to extend the Hyprland configuration directly e.g., if you want to add another autostart command, environment variable, etc. you can edit the custom.conf in `~/.config/hypr/conf/custom.conf` The custom.conf can be restored during an update. You can open the custom.conf from the ML4W Dotfiles Settings App.

## Using the Installation `hook.sh`

And you can protect files and folders from getting overwritten from an update by using the Installation Hook or with the file PROTECTED. Check `Preserve Config & customize`
